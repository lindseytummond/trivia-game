2.  If the player selects the correct answer, a screen congratulating them for choosing the correct option will appear. After a few seconds, the next question will display without user input.
3.  The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
4.  If the player runs out of time, the player's time is up and the correct answer displays. Wait a few seconds, then the next question displays.
5.  If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player will see the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then the next question displays.
